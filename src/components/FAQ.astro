    question: "What channels can I connect to Replaid?",
    answer: "You can connect Instagram (DMs and comments), WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Twitter/X, Telegram, and email. We're actively adding new platforms — let us know what you need."
  },
  {
    question: "Can Replaid respond automatically to messages?",
    answer: "Yes! Replaid uses AI to send instant replies, filter spam, answer FAQs, and qualify leads — all while maintaining your brand voice. You control how much automation you want."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Replaid without auto-replies?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Many teams use Replaid purely for lead scoring, notifications, and smart prioritization while handling replies manually. You get all the intelligence without automation."
  },
  {
    question: "How does lead qualification work?",
    answer: "Our AI analyzes message intent, sentiment, and urgency using natural language processing. It assigns scores from 0-100, categorizes conversations, and can trigger alerts when high-value leads come in."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it hard to set up? Do I need to code?",
    answer: "Not at all. Replaid is 100% no-code. Connect your channels with OAuth, upload your knowledge base, and you're live. Most teams are up and running in under 10 minutes."
  },
  {
    question: "What about data privacy and security?",
    answer: "Security is our priority. All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256). We're GDPR compliant, never share your data, and you can delete everything anytime. SOC 2 Type II certification in progress."
