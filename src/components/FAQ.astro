  { q: "What channels can I connect to Replaid?", a: "You can connect Facebook Messenger, Instagram (DMs and comments), WhatsApp, Telegram, Twitter (Beta), and more. We're continuously adding new platforms based on user demand." },
  { q: "Can Replaid respond automatically to DMs and comments?", a: "Yes. Replaid uses AI to send automatic replies, filter out spam, answer common questions, and help you move real leads through your funnel." },
  { q: "Can I use Replaid without automatic replies?", a: "Yes. You can disable auto-replies and still use Replaid to filter leads, send notifications, and automate workflows. Great if you want to reply manually but still streamline your process." },
  { q: "How does Replaid qualify leads?", a: "It analyzes message intent using natural language processing to detect interest, assign categories, and trigger notifications or automations so you can focus on the most valuable conversations." },
  { q: "Is it hard to set up? Do I need to code anything?", a: "Not at all. Replaid is fully no-code. Just connect your channels, configure your preferences, and you're ready to go." },
