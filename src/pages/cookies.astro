      <p class="text-ink-300">Last updated on March 19, 2025</p>

      <p>REPLAID.pro ("us", "we", or "our") uses cookies on Replaid (the "Service"). By using the Service, you consent to the use of cookies.</p>

      <p>Our Cookie Policy explains what cookies are, how we use them, how third parties we may partner with use them, your choices regarding cookies, and further information about cookies.</p>

      <h3>What Are Cookies</h3>

      <p>Cookies are small pieces of text sent by your web browser by a website you visit. A cookie file is stored in your browser and allows the Service or a third party to recognize you and make your next visit easier and the Service more useful to you.</p>

      <p>Cookies can be "persistent" or "session" cookies. They are associated with the browser, not the person, so they do not usually store sensitive information such as credit card or bank details, photos, or personal data. The data they contain are typically technical, statistical, or preference-related.</p>

      <h4>Third-Party Cookies</h4>

      <p>The site may use third-party services, such as Google, to collect information for statistical purposes, analyze site usage, and provide other web-related services.</p>
