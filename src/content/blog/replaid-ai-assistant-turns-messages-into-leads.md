## Turn Every Message into a Lead with Replaid

In today's world, customers don't wait.

They send DMs on Instagram, comment on Facebook, or ask quick questions on WhatsApp. Every message could be a lead, but only if you reply fast enough.

However, when conversations pile up across multiple channels, staying on top of them becomes almost impossible. Messages get lost, leads grow cold, and your brand misses real opportunities.

That's exactly why we built Replaid, your new AI inbox assistant that turns messages into leads automatically.

## The Problem

Most businesses still handle messages manually. One person checks Instagram. Another handles Facebook comments. Someone else manages WhatsApp.

As a result, teams waste hours switching tabs, typing the same replies, and trying to qualify real leads from noise.

Fortunately, Replaid fixes this by combining AI automation, unified inboxing, and smart workflows in one simple dashboard.

## How Replaid Works

With Replaid, you can turn message chaos into a lead generation system that runs on autopilot. The setup takes just a few simple steps.

### 1. Create Your Account

Start by signing up for Replaid. No setup headaches, no API tokens, and no code.

Everything runs in the cloud and is ready within minutes.

### 2. Connect Your Social Media Channels

Link Instagram, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, email, or any other supported platform.

From that moment on, every message arrives in one place, your Replaid dashboard.

### 3. Define Your Brand Guidelines

Tell Replaid how your brand speaks.

Set your tone, language, and brand rules so AI always answers in your style. This way, every response feels natural and consistent.

### 4. Upload Your Knowledge and Connect Databases

Add FAQs, product details, or support docs, everything your team already knows.

In addition, Replaid lets you connect internal databases or live data sources. This means the AI can pull real-time information like prices, stock, bookings, or any custom data you store.

As a result, your replies are not only fast but also accurate and always up to date.

### 5. Create One or More Workflows

Workflows are the brain behind your automation.

You can route messages, qualify leads, trigger notifications, or send instant AI replies.

For example, you can create a rule like this:

*If a message includes price or demo, mark it as a hot lead and notify the sales team.*

Therefore, your team focuses on what matters most, closing deals.

### 6. Done. Replaid Runs on Autopilot

Once setup is complete, Replaid starts working for you 24/7.

It filters spam, detects intent, and replies automatically. Meanwhile, your team spends more time building relationships instead of managing inboxes.
