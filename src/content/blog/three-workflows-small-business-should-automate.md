Running a small business means wearing every hat: sales, support, marketing, and sometimes even IT.

But here's the truth: most of those daily messages, emails, and DMs do not need your personal touch. They just need to be handled quickly, accurately, and in your tone.

That is where automation saves your time and your sanity. With the right workflows, you can respond faster, qualify leads automatically, and keep customers happy, all without lifting a finger.

Let's walk through the three essential workflows every small business should set up today using AI and Replaid.

## 1. The Lead Qualification Workflow

Leads often arrive disguised as short messages like "price?", "do you ship to Italy?", or "can I book a demo?". Behind those quick questions are people ready to buy.

The problem is that by the time you find those DMs among the noise, they have already gone cold.

With Replaid, you can automate how those messages are detected, tagged, and replied to instantly.

### How it works:

- **Detect intent** – Replaid's AI scans all incoming messages for buying signals like price, quote, booking, demo, or order.
- **Tag as "Hot Lead"** – Any message with clear purchase intent gets a lead tag automatically.
- **Instant reply** – The AI sends a friendly, on-brand message like: "Hey! 👋 Great to hear from you, here's the quick link to book a demo or check pricing 👉 [link]."
- **Notify your team** – A Slack or email alert lets you or your sales rep jump in when needed.

### Why it matters:

Every second counts. Studies show that replying within 10 minutes can increase conversions by more than 400%. With automation, you can do it in seconds, even while you sleep.

## 2. The Support Triage Workflow

Customer support messages are part of daily business life, but replying to each one manually can drain your entire day.

Shipping times, order updates, and password resets are predictable questions with answers you already have in your FAQs or templates.

Replaid allows AI to use that existing knowledge to reply instantly and only escalate what truly needs a human response.

### How it works:

- **Centralize your inbox** – Connect Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, or email into Replaid's unified dashboard.
- **Upload your knowledge base** – Add FAQs, policies, and docs so AI always gives accurate answers.
- **Reply instantly** – Example: "When will my order arrive?" → "Your order ships within 24h and usually arrives in 3–5 days 🚚."
- **Escalate smartly** – If a message shows frustration or complexity, Replaid flags it for human attention.

### Why it matters:

Customers expect fast and consistent help. Automating repetitive support messages saves hours while keeping your brand tone aligned and professional.

## 3. The Inbox Prioritization Workflow

When you are managing conversations across Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and email, not every message deserves the same attention.

Some are hot leads. Others are support requests. And many are distractions that take time away from real opportunities.

Manually sorting through all of that noise costs time, focus, and potential sales.

Replaid uses AI to automatically prioritize what matters most so you and your team can focus on real customers, not clutter.

### How it works:

- **Detect intent and tone** – Replaid scans every message to understand its purpose, such as lead, support, pre-sale question, or spam.
- **Auto-tag and sort** – Each message is labeled and routed into the right category inside your unified inbox.
- **Flag priorities** – Urgent or high-value leads are highlighted and moved to the top of your queue.
- **Filter noise** – Spam, irrelevant, or repetitive messages are automatically muted or archived.

### Why it matters:

An organized inbox saves hours every week. By letting AI classify and prioritize conversations, you always know which messages drive sales, which need attention, and which can wait.

## Putting It All Together

These three workflows—Lead Qualification, Support Triage, and Inbox Prioritization—form the foundation of an always-on, fully automated customer experience.

Once set up, Replaid runs 24/7 while you focus on growth.

- **Before:** 6-hour response times, missed DMs, and waiting customers.
- **After:** Replies in seconds, qualified leads on autopilot, and happier clients.

Automation does not remove your human touch. It enhances it by helping you focus your time where it truly matters.

## How to Build Them in Replaid

1. **Connect your channels** – One click to sync Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, or email.
2. **Add your brand knowledge** – Upload FAQs, product info, and tone guidelines.
3. **Create workflows** – Define triggers like "price", "order", or "thank you".
4. **Set actions** – Auto-reply, tag, assign, or notify team members.
5. **Test and watch** – Replaid starts replying instantly and improves with every interaction.

Within days, your inbox transforms from chaos into organized clarity.

## The Bottom Line

Automation is not just for big companies—it is for smart ones.

Setting up these three workflows today means more time, more sales, and fewer missed opportunities tomorrow.
